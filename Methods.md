# Methods


## Sample Collection


## Sequencing


## Genome Assembly


## Genome QC

The phi-X174 nucleotide sequence obtained from NCBI (NC_001422.1) was BLASTed (blastn and tblastx version 2.6.0) against the assembled genome with default settings.


## Identity of the MT genome

The Odocoileus virginianus texanus MT genome was downloaded from NCBI and blastn (version 2.6.0) was used to identify scaffolds with sequence similarity with default settings.
