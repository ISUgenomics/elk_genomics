## Organism
* [Scientific name: Cervus canadensis](https://www.google.com/search?q=north_american_elk&oq=north_american_elk&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.428j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

* [Number of chromosomes = 34 pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_organisms_by_chromosome_count)

## Objective

Purpose: Just got back last night from WDA.  The animal used for the assembly was a male so we could get both the X and Y chromosomes.  We have illumina data on elk from the Greater Yellowstone Area and from a captive herd that the plan is to compare to the sequence to get an estimation of variance in the genome and where.
