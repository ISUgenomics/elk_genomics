# Recent whole genome publications

* **Microbiology Resource Announcements (MRA)**  is an online-only, fully open access journal that publishes articles announcing the availability of any microbiological resource deposited in a repository available to the community. In addition to genome sequences of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes and viruses in public databases, as published in Genome Announcements, MRA will consider metagenomics sequences, amplicon sequence collections, metabolomics data, proteome data, culture collections, mutant libraries, plasmids and other genetic constructs, publicly available databases and software, and protocols and workflows. An **American Society for Microbiology** journal with eliminated Impact factor!
