No significant hits were identified to indicate contamination with PhiX

Without a genome sequence, identifying Elk genes that respond to Brucella infection would be impossible. Here we present the first pseudomolecule assembly of the rocky mountain elk, generated with xxx of sequencing data and xx fold coverage of the genome. An initial assembly of xxx contigs was generated using MaSuRCA with an N50 of xx and xxx contigs.  This assembly was assembled into 35 psuedomolecules using 150 gbp of HiC sequencing and the Juicer, Juice Box, and the 3D-DNA pipeline.
For gene annotation we generated xxx of sequencing for six tissues, including kidney, lung, Mes, muscle, scap, and spleen
