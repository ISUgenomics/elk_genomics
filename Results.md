## Assembly
Without a genome sequence, identifying Elk genes that respond to Brucella infection would be impossible. Here we present the first pseudomolecule assembly of the rocky mountain elk, generated with xxx of sequencing data and xx fold coverage of the genome. An initial assembly of 23,302 contigs was generated using MaSuRCA with an N50 of xx and L90 of xxx contigs. This assembly was assembled into 35 psuedomolecules using 150 gbp of HiC sequencing and the Juicer, Juice Box, and the 3D-DNA pipeline. Assembly quality was verified via mapping illumina and Pacbio CCS reads to the assembly, with alignment percentages at 90.7% and 87.3% respectively.   


## Mitochondrial Genome

The mitochondrial genome is XX bases long with YY gene models.

Three large mitochondrial integrations were identified in the genome ranging from 93-99% identical on HiC_scaffold_23, HiC_scaffold_33, and HiC_scaffold_34.


## Gene Prediction
For gene annotation we generated 1.5 billion paired end reads of sequencing from six tissues, including kidney, lung, Mes, muscle, scap, and spleen.
