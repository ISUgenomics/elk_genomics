# Introduction

Elk were nearly exterminated from the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and British Columbia in the early 1900s, (Stelfox 1964but were restocked between 1916-1920 with elk from The Greater Yellowstone Area (Lloyd 1927; Green 1946; Lothian 1981).  By 1940 Elk populations expanded so greatly, to necessitate periodic culling (Green 1946; Flook 1967). However, Elk in the Greater Yellowstone Area are also known to be a wild reservoir for brucellosis, a problematic implication for eradicating brucellosis from domestic livestock (Godfroid, 2002).
