Elk were nearly exterminated from the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and British Columbia in the early 1900s, (Stelfox 1964but were restocked between 1916-1920 with elk from The Greater Yellowstone Area (Lloyd 1927; Green 1946; Lothian 1981).  By 1940 Elk populations expanded so greatly, to necessitate periodic culling (Green 1946; Flook 1967). However, Elk in the Greater Yellowstone Area are also known to be a wild reservoir for brucellosis, a problematic implication for eradicating brucellosis from domestic livestock (Godfroid, 2002).

I could be remembering incorrectly but I believe we did kidney, lung, mesenteric lymph node, muscle, prescapular lymph node, and spleen for RNA-seq.  The samples from Wyoming (free ranging elk) were all white blood cells but that was because the sampling was non-lethal.  I thought we randomly selected 6 elk from the wild population and 6 from a domestic elk herd for comparative sequencing. My memory is that the RNA-seq data was generated opportunistically on 6 tissues from the one elk on site that was being euthanized.  I don’t want to delay the publication of the elk genome but we could certainly do additional work in the future to generate more RNA-seq data.

We are certainly interested in the immune function of the rocky mountain elk. The rationale for sequencing was because elk in the area of Yellowstone National Park have a significant level of disease prevalence for brucellosis.  Elk have been implicated in more than 20 cases of transmission of brucellosis to domestic cattle in that area over the last 15 years.  We have a national eradication program for brucellosis in cattle which is essentially close to completion after expenditure of billions of dollars over the last 60 to 70 years.  It’s quite ironic that elk are giving it back to cattle because epidemiologic data indicates that the disease was transmitted to elk from cattle.  Because each incident where a cattle herd gets infected can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to resolve, we have been working to develop vaccines in elk that could potentially be given to free-ranging populations.  Lots of issues to address including environmental safety but so far elk immune responses are quite different from other species.  They develop predominantly antibody responses (which are not protective) and very negligible cellular immune response (which are protective).  We are certain this is a genetically controlled immune issue and need to do more work looking at gene expression after vaccination and infection.  Therefore, we need a well annotated genome to do this work.
